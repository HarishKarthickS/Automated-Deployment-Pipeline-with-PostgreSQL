# 🚀 Automated Deployment Pipeline with PostgreSQL

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the world of effortless deployment! This project brings you an **automated deployment pipeline** for a Flask application that seamlessly integrates with PostgreSQL. Using the power of **Docker and Docker Compose**, you can deploy like a pro with minimal hassle. Sit back, relax, and let automation do the heavy lifting! 😎

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd automated-deployment-pipeline
```

### 2️⃣ Build the Docker Images
```bash
./ci/build.sh
```

### 3️⃣ Deploy the Application
```bash
./ci/deploy.sh
```

### 4️⃣ Access Your Deployed App
Open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:5000
```
Boom! Your app is live. 🎉

## 🛠 Components Breakdown
### 🐍 **Flask Application (app.py)**
A snappy Flask app that talks to PostgreSQL and fetches cool data for you.

### 🗄 **Database Initialization (init.sql)**
Prepares the PostgreSQL database with a fresh structure and some tasty sample data. 🍽

### 📦 **Docker Containers**
- Flask application container 🏗
- PostgreSQL database container 💾

### 🤖 **CI Scripts**
- **build.sh**: Crafts your Docker image like a master sculptor. 🎨
- **deploy.sh**: Deploys your app faster than a pizza delivery. 🚀

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask) 🐍
- **PostgreSQL** 🗄
- **Docker & Docker Compose** 🐳
- **Shell scripting** 🖥

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Magic Behind the Curtain 🎩)
1️⃣ **Package the app into a Docker image** 📦
2️⃣ **Spin up PostgreSQL and the Flask app using Docker Compose** 🏗
3️⃣ **Initialize the database with tables and sample data** 🛠
4️⃣ **Expose the app on port 5000 and celebrate! 🎉**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting (A.K.A. "Why Isn't This Working?!")
If things go sideways, don’t panic! Try these:
- Make sure **Docker & Docker Compose** are installed 🐳
- Check if your database is actually running: `docker ps`
- Get a sneak peek at logs: `docker-compose logs`
